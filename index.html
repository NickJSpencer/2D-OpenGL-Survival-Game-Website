<h1>Project Description</h1>
<div>
  <p>
    My project is a 2.5D game that is set on the moon. It emphasizes gameplay over the quality of the graphics (was it not a game design class?).
    The objective of the game is to survive as long as you possibly can without being touched by any of the red enemies. 
  </p>
  <p>  
    The enemies always follow you along a linear path (though if you move, the enemies appear to move along a curve. This is due to the direction of the enemies updating every tick in your direction. Since you move, the direction of the enemy changes, therefore they move on a curved path).
    You initially can fire a projectile every 0.5 seconds at the enemies that instantly kill them. You can also dash for a moment when the spacebar is pressed.
    This works for several seconds, but the enemies begin to spawn more and more frequently. Additionally, they increase in speed over time.
  </p>
  <p>
    To compensate for the increase in difficulty, powerups spawn every 10 seconds around the map. These powerups affect you in 4 different ways:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Increases Player Movement Speed
    </li>
    <li>
      Decreases Projectile Cooldown
    </li>
    <li>
      Activates / Decreases Cooldown for Projectile Randomizer (sends out projectiles in random directions)
    </li>
    <li>
      Decreases Dash Cooldown (Once the cooldown gets small enough, the player can dash indefinitely)
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    These powerups all look the same. No matter what, the player needs to get every powerup that pops up on the map, or they will lose a lot faster. 
    It does not matter which powerup each one is because they all are useful and vital to get.
    Although there is a very significant increase in the abilities of the player over time, this ultimately gets outweighed by the enemies' onslaught.
    It would be improbable to get so powerful as to nullify the enemies' increase in power. You will most definitely die at some point.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the moment there is no way to save the highest score, but the console box displays the current time in seconds that you have survived in the current session.
    However, once you die, the program closes and the time is thrown out.
