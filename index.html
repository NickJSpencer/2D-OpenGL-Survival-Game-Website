<h1>Project Description</h1>
<div>
  You wake up on the moon in a daze not knowing what happened. 
  All that's left of you is your spirit inside a hovering gold ball. 
  You look around.
  You see something in the distance.
  It looks the same as you, but different.
  As it gets closer, it becomes more menacing; more red.
  It is best to move away from it.
  But it follows you.
  And wait.
  It couldn't be.
  There is another one to the left of you.
  And wait.
  There is another to the right of you.
  They are all headed in your direction.
  Greatness awaits your survival.
