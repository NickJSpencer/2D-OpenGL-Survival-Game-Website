<h1>Project Description</h1>
<div>
  <div>
    My project is a 2.5D game that is set on the moon. It emphasizes gameplay over the quality of the graphics (was it not a game design class?).
    The objective of the game is to survive as long as you possibly can without being touched by any of the red enemies. 
  </div>
  <div>  
    The enemies always follow you along a linear path (though if you move, the enemies appear to move along a curve. This is due to the direction of the enemies updating every tick in your direction. Since you move, the direction of the enemy changes, therefore they move on a curved path).
    You initially can fire a projectile every 0.5 seconds at the enemies that instantly kill them. You can also dash for a moment when the spacebar is pressed.
    This works for several seconds, but the enemies begin to spawn more and more frequently. Additionally, they increase in speed over time.

    To compensate for the increase in difficulty, powerups spawn every 10 seconds around the map. These powerups increase 4 different categories.
